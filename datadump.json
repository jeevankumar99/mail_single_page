body\n\nFirst, after making and applying migrations for the project, run python manage.py runserver to start the web server. Open the web server in your browser, and use the \u201cRegister\u201d link to register for a new account. The emails you\u2019ll be sending and receiving in this project will be entirely stored in your database (they won\u2019t actually be sent to real email servers), so you\u2019re welcome to choose any email address (e.g. foo@example.com) and password you\u2019d like for this project: credentials need not be valid credentials for actual email addresses.\n\nOnce you\u2019re signed in, you should see yourself taken to the Inbox page of the mail client, though this page is mostly blank (for now). Click the buttons to navigate to your Sent and Archived mailboxes, and notice how those, too, are currently blank. Click the \u201cCompose\u201d button, and you\u2019ll be taken to a form that will let you compose a new email. Each time you click a button, though, you\u2019re not being taken to a new route or making a new web request: instead, this entire application is just a single page, with JavaScript used to control the user interface. Let\u2019s now take a closer look at the distribution code to see how that works.\n\nTake a look at mail/urls.py and notice that the default route loads an index function in views.py. So let\u2019s up views.py and look at the index function. Notice that, as long as the user is signed in, this function renders the mail/inbox.html template. Let\u2019s look at that template, stored at mail/templates/mail/inbox.html. You\u2019ll notice that in the body of the page, the user\u2019s email address is first displayed in an h2 element. After that, the page has a sequence of buttons for navigating between various pages of the app. Below that, notice that this page has two main sections, each defined by a div element. The first (with an id of emails-view) contains the content of an email mailbox (initially empty). The second (with an id of compose-view) contains a form where the user can compose a new email. The buttons along the top, then, need to selectively show and hide these views: the compose button, for example, should hide the emails-view and show the compose-view; the inbox button, meanwhile, should hide the compose-view and show the emails-view.\n\nHow do they do that? Notice at the bottom of inbox.html, the JavaScript file mail/inbox.js is included. Open that file, stored at mail/static/mail/inbox.js, and take a look. Notice that when the DOM content of the page has been loaded, we attach event listeners to each of the buttons. When the inbox button is clicked, for example, we call the load_mailbox function with the argument 'inbox'; when the compose button is clicked, meanwhile, we call the compose_email function. What do these functions do? The compose_email function first hides the emails-view (by setting its style.display property to none) and shows the compose-view (by setting its style.display property to block). After that, the function takes all of the form input fields (where the user might type in a recipient email address, subject line, and email body) and sets their value to the empty string '' to clear them out. This means that every time you click the \u201cCompose\u201d button, you should be presented with a blank email form: you can test this by typing values into form, switching the view to the Inbox, and then switching back to the Compose view.\n\nMeanwhile, the load_mailbox function first shows the emails-view and hides the compose-view. The load_mailbox function also takes an argument, which will be the name of the mailbox that the user is trying to view. For this project, you\u2019ll design an email client with three mailboxes: an inbox, a sent mailbox of all sent mail, and an archive of emails that were once in the inbox but have since been archived. The argument to load_mailbox, then, will be one of those three values, and the load_mailbox function displays the name of the selected mailbox by updating the innerHTML of the emails-view (after capitalizing the first character). This is why, when you choose a mailbox name in the browser, you see the name of that mailbox (capitalized) appear in the DOM: the load_mailbox function is updating the emails-view to include the appropriate text.\n\nOf course, this application is incomplete. All of the mailboxes simply show the name of the mailbox (Inbox, Sent, Archive) but don\u2019t actually show any emails yet. There\u2019s no view yet to actually see the contents of any email. And the compose form will let you type in the contents of an email, but the button to send the email doesn\u2019t actually do anything. That\u2019s where you come in!", "timestamp": "2020-10-04T10:39:24.483Z", "read": true, "archived": false, "recipients": [15]}}, {"model": "mail.email", "pk": 452, "fields": {"user": 15, "sender": 9, "subject": "Scroll check LONG", "body": "This is to check the scroll on mail body\n\nFirst, after making and applying migrations for the project, run python manage.py runserver to start the web server. Open the web server in your browser, and use the \u201cRegister\u201d link to register for a new account. The emails you\u2019ll be sending and receiving in this project will be entirely stored in your database (they won\u2019t actually be sent to real email servers), so you\u2019re welcome to choose any email address (e.g. foo@example.com) and password you\u2019d like for this project: credentials need not be valid credentials for actual email addresses.\n\nOnce you\u2019re signed in, you should see yourself taken to the Inbox page of the mail client, though this page is mostly blank (for now). Click the buttons to navigate to your Sent and Archived mailboxes, and notice how those, too, are currently blank. Click the \u201cCompose\u201d button, and you\u2019ll be taken to a form that will let you compose a new email. Each time you click a button, though, you\u2019re not being taken to a new route or making a new web request: instead, this entire application is just a single page, with JavaScript used to control the user interface. Let\u2019s now take a closer look at the distribution code to see how that works.\n\nTake a look at mail/urls.py and notice that the default route loads an index function in views.py. So let\u2019s up views.py and look at the index function. Notice that, as long as the user is signed in, this function renders the mail/inbox.html template. Let\u2019s look at that template, stored at mail/templates/mail/inbox.html. You\u2019ll notice that in the body of the page, the user\u2019s email address is first displayed in an h2 element. After that, the page has a sequence of buttons for navigating between various pages of the app. Below that, notice that this page has two main sections, each defined by a div element. The first (with an id of emails-view) contains the content of an email mailbox (initially empty). The second (with an id of compose-view) contains a form where the user can compose a new email. The buttons along the top, then, need to selectively show and hide these views: the compose button, for example, should hide the emails-view and show the compose-view; the inbox button, meanwhile, should hide the compose-view and show the emails-view.\n\nHow do they do that? Notice at the bottom of inbox.html, the JavaScript file mail/inbox.js is included. Open that file, stored at mail/static/mail/inbox.js, and take a look. Notice that when the DOM content of the page has been loaded, we attach event listeners to each of the buttons. When the inbox button is clicked, for example, we call the load_mailbox function with the argument 'inbox'; when the compose button is clicked, meanwhile, we call the compose_email function. What do these functions do? The compose_email function first hides the emails-view (by setting its style.display property to none) and shows the compose-view (by setting its style.display property to block).
